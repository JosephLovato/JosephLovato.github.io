  <p>Chaos Theory; Groceries; Oh Won‚Äôt You</p>

<p>Welcome back my faithful virtual friends. In this post, I explore a few things mathematical, a few things dogmatical, a few things emblematical, and a few things fanatical‚Ä¶ Because!‚Ä¶ I am on sabbatical. Ohhh, isn‚Äôt rhyming fun? Well, so is being abroad. Enjoy my microcosm of Rome, presented to you via the one and only world wide web.</p>

<h3 id="-chaos-theory">üåÄ Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>Walking the streets of Rome are an activity beyond transportation. To get from my apartment to class, I must tiptoe through Trastevere. From the Roman Forum to lunch; stroll along the Tiber. From H&amp;M to the park; strut along pedestrian boulevards ‚Äîand this is what I am coming to love about this city. You don‚Äôt get in a car and zone out for 20 minutes. Instead, you‚Äôre forced to interact with the city, smelling food, hearing conversations, and rummaging through streets filled with people of all varieties, leading storied lives.</p>

<p>Okay, so there‚Äôs a lot to unpack in the preceding paragraph. But for this week, I want to take a moment to explore a consequence of that last point. As you walk through any city, it is clear that much of the respective complexity comes from the large quantity of people, each pursuing their individual daily actions. Martha goes to get her nails done. Tony goes to school. Cassandra goes to work at the cafe. Luke goes to dinner. And on and on and on. But, in Rome, specifically Trastevere, this complexity can be seen on a more human level than most American cities, where cars dominate the transportation system. For example, there is an intersection in Trastevere which I walk through multiple times a day. It connects one large road and 3 smaller ones, all of which are cobblestone. A caf√© and restaurant occupy the corners, the caf√© being an extremely busy establishment. Each time I walk through this intersection, I am impressed by the quantity of people (and some vehicles) which pass through every minute, seen below.</p>

<br>Intersection of Via di Porta Settimiana, Via di Santa Dorotea, Via Garibaldi and Via della Scala (looking south)\
</center>

<p>As I sit at the busy caf√© with my coffee, I see students, newspaper distributers, couples, groups of friends, school children, elderly women and many others, coming from one way and going another. It all seems very chaotic. Every bump, honk and conversation affecting the next minute of activity. This notion of chaos, one of the reason‚Äôs I chose to study road-systems for my practicum, is inherently difficult to model. There are so many variables and human decisions in that one intersection, it becomes difficult to imagine blowing the scale up to the entirety of Rome.</p>

<p>Edward Lorenz, a mathematician and meteorologist who worked primarily in the 20th century, was a pioneer in modeling chaos, something which had been an oxymoron for much of the study of mathematics before his time. Through his research with atmospheric modeling equations, he concluded that some systems are very sensitive to initial conditions, such that even a 0.001% change in starting values will completely alter the resulting trajectory of the system. A common example of this is the double-rod pendulum, whose motion is extremely chaotic despite the simplicity of the mechanisms in place. Lorenz also showed that despite chaos, groups of initial conditions can be attracted to central locations, thus birthing his famous Lorenz Attractor graphs, seen below.</p>

<p>Researching chaos theory has opened my eyes to just how we might be able to model road systems. Rome‚Äôs road systems are chaotic, but I feel there is an underlying mechanism at play. What the mechanism is, I‚Äôm still unsure, but with Lorenz‚Äôs ideas in my tool belt, I am initiating a few experimental procedures to further my research:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I have set up a GPS logger on my phone. This raw data will be useful to my analyses of using Rome‚Äôs road system over long periods of time (3 months)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intersection in Trastevere I spoke of earlier, drawn below, will become my primary data-gathering center during the next few weeks. I really want to investigate what is going one here, and I predict that analyzing one intersection in Rome (which is within my grasp) might reveal hints to the function of the entire city.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-anecdote--groceries">Weekly Anecdote: üõí Groceries</h3>
<p>In a place which is unfamiliar, I find that habitual tendencies help to make it more familiar over time. Thus, I‚Äôm not surprised that over the last month, I have formed a habit of making pilgrimage to the grocery store every Monday morning. I don‚Äôt have class in the morning, so I can take my time getting up, eating breakfast, and making the journey. But, would I make this the weekly anecdote if there wasn‚Äôt a but? Well, here it is‚Ä¶ But, last Wednesday was a bit different. I got a late start to the day, so I only had ~1 hour to make the trip before class. After fast-walking there and doing my typical path through the produce, bakery and various isles, I paid and double stepped the stairs back up to the sidewalk (the store is in the basement of a clothing retailer). So there I was with three heavy bags filled with much more that I had intended on getting (a common problem of mine) and only ~20 minutes to make it all the way home and then to class. I knew that with the load, I was not going to be able to walk. But, propped gracefully on their kickstands near the edge of the sidewalk were two red bikes. They were JUMP bikes. I had seen them many times before and vaguely knew that they were rental bikes made by Uber. Luckily, I had downloaded the app knowing that I would, at some point, try one. So, I scanned the QR code on the bike, fumbled with the lock until it came undone, put one bag in the basket and one on either handle, saddled up and put the kickstand in its horizontal position. The next part of this story still makes me chuckle. These JUMP bikes turn out to be partly motorized! So, one turn of the pedal shot me down the sidewalk. Ahhhh! Imagine me, an American guy on a red bike, speeding down the streets of Rome with groceries bags knocking into his knees, swerving around curbs and bumpy cobblestone. I did end up making it home and to class on time‚Ä¶ phew.</p>

<p>So, what did I learn from this little adventure? First, riding a bike in Rome is an acquired talent (quite unlike anything I‚Äôve experienced before‚Äîit‚Äôs more like playing dodgeball than riding a bike). Second, it is usually strenuous circumstances which make us try the craziest things. Third, although scary the first time, Rome‚Äôs roads are quite accommodating to multiple means of transportation. And finally, I learned when I do this again, to make sure the eggs are at the top of the bag. Last week Rome‚Äôs roads ripped my pants. This week, they cracked a half-dozen eggs‚Äîthrough vibration, yes‚Äîbut still. Curses.</p>

<p>More on those JUMP bikes next week. I‚Äôm intrigued :)</p>

<h3 id="Ô∏è-oh-wont-you">‚ù§Ô∏è Oh Won‚Äôt You</h3>
<p>Oh, Roma‚Ä¶
Won‚Äôt you sing to me in the moonlight
Won‚Äôt you call out my name
Won‚Äôt you mingle in the night
Won‚Äôt you know your fame</p>

<p>Won‚Äôt you share your legions of aroma
Won‚Äôt you spritz perfume
Won‚Äôt you take me home-a
Won‚Äôt you arise from a tomb</p>

<p>Won‚Äôt you open of bottle of wine
Won‚Äôt you fall in love
Won‚Äôt you build a shrine
Won‚Äôt you tell me what you‚Äôre made of</p>

<p>Won‚Äôt you feel the buzz
Won‚Äôt you give me roses
Won‚Äôt you do what Santa Maria does
Won‚Äôt you be what prose is</p>

<p>Oh Roma‚Ä¶
Won‚Äôt you be my cloud nine
Won‚Äôt you consider it, please
Won‚Äôt you be my Valentine
Because I‚Äôm in love, won‚Äôt you see</p>

<h3 id="-until-next-time">üëã Until Next Time</h3>
<p>Thank you, again, for reading my blog. As I investigate, uncover, and research the essence of this city, I‚Äôm finding that Rome has just as much to say about itself as it does about me. Assimilation is more than osmosis‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a becoming. Until next time‚Ä¶ Ciao!</p>

<h3 id="well-there-was-no-next-time">Well‚Ä¶ there was no next time</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, in the weeks after I wrote this blog, COVID-19 swept through Italy, and then the world. I had to come home early from my study abroad üò¢ But, the time I did have in Europe was *chefs kiss*. In the two weeks prior to flying back to the US, I was able to travel to the UK, exploring London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. COVID-19 was a shock to all of us‚Äîand many people suffered much <em>much</em> more than me. So, I‚Äôm not bitter. But, I do have an intense motivation to get back out there and make up the 2 months that I lost‚Ä¶ and many more üòÑ</p>
