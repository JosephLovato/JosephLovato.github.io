<blockquote>
  <p>“Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.” Don’t be resigned to that. Break out!”</p>

<p>We are all Mr. Keating students, so here is poem inspired by his call to action. <em>Carpe diem</em>, as they say.</p>

  <div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: left">
    Desire to Feel <br />
    <i>By Joey Lovato </i> <br /> <br />
    The desire to my life <br />
    Is the flesh to my bones <br />
    It animates my essence as <br />
    I walk wistfully  <br />
    Through Eve's garden <br />
    Tempted not by Apple <br />
    But by Adam's Apple <br />
    Ever aware of my nakedness <br />
    Less I find a leaf <br />
    To cover who I am <br />
    Or the parts I want to hide <br /> <br />
    Love is pain <br />
    As we enter this world <br />
    Intrepid in our first <br />
    Taste of sense <br />
    Only to learn that <br />
    To sense is to feel and <br />
    To feel is to know <br />
    What we desire <br />
    What love is and is not <br /> <br />
    Knots of anguish <br />
    Hands of happiness <br />
    Slowly, softly untie me <br />
    Of these binds to my own withdrawal <br />
    From the pursuit of my desire <br />
    For my flesh is my life and <br />
    These bones etch a silhouette  <br />
    Of a soul who craves nothing more than <br />
    To animate a life  <br />
    Not towards happiness <br />
    But of it <br /> <br />
    Tell that silly serpent a story <br />
    Of a God who cares not what you are <br />
    But what you feel  <br />
    For we are not just humans being <br />
    We are humans feeling <br />
    Reaching for meaning <br />
    In the depths of worldly distractions <br />
    Only to find it when we finally  <br />
    Close our eyes and  <br />
    Desire to feel <br />

Here’s how it went.</p>

<p>Last July, I set out to improve my poetry. I’ve dabbled in poetry, but have focused primarily on prose and journalistic pieces in my writing career. As with any skill, practice is key. So, I figured why not challenge myself to write poetry regularly. Knowing my personality, I also knew that having an audience, that is a body of people who would judge and possibly critique my poetry, would provide motivation to continue writing. I rarely post on social media, so I thought using my SnapChat (and sometimes Instagram) stories as a medium would serve as a good use of the platform(s).</p>

<p>The Haiku is a simple, short poetry form that is easily accessible to a novice poet like me, so it was an obvious choice. The Haiku is also easy to format on a portrait-oriented digital canvas—a natural bonus. So, without any context or explanation to the sudden stream of poetry broadcasting through my social media, I started posting. On “accident” (subliminal purpose), I began posting my poetry over sunsets. Sunsets are my favorite natural phenomena, their beauty and diversity inspiring many of my poems.</p>

<p>Below are a collection of my poems written throughout the past year. It is clear to me now that the Haiku tell a story—one of pain, one of purpose-finding, one of happiness, one of bliss. Read between the lines, and you may just find the story of a boy (man) as he navigates this wacky, beautiful life.</p>

     <br /> <small>My favorite 2023 reading spot, during sunset of course; <a href="mailto:joeylovato1@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> me a book recommendation and I'll tell you where it is! </small>
</div>

<p>This year has been quite the wild ride with books! After finishing grad school December of 2022, I made it a mission to read more, both nonfiction and fiction. I am writing this post to (a) synthesize my takeaways from each book and (b) share my reviews. The same book can be a very different experience for each reader, so take my reviews as what they are: opinions. I will not rate my reviews on any kind of numeric scale, but instead give short blurbs, not dissimilar to what you might read on the cover of one of these books, unless—of course—the blurb is more critical than complimentary.</p>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for fans of Vox (Gladwell writes a lot like how Vox makes video essays)</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for anyone with a dislike for repetition</em></p>

<p>I found myself quoting and bringing up many of the ideas Gladwell lays out in this book in my daily life. Gladwell has mastered the ability to clearly argue his points with storied evidence and leave a residue of curiosity on every reader. However, Gladwell does rely heavily on one obvious form of rhetoric: repetition. The book could have been condensed by a quarter. But, as the skilled essayist that he is, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that this tactic keeps the reader engaged and constantly reaffirming his thesis—a forced “stickiness”.</p>

<p><strong>🃏 Moonwalking with Einstein</strong> by <em>Joshua Foer</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The story of a young journalist who, in studying memory champions, becomes one himself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for anyone in search of ways to improve memory</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for memory champions, as you probably know everything already</em></p>

<p>Foer’s story of becoming a memory champion is captivating, interesting, and impressive. The primary goal of memorizing a deck of cards leads Foer on a journey you just can’t put down. Although I do not have any interest in training my memory to the levels Foer and other memory champions did, I do regularly utilize the memory techniques I learned from the book in my daily life (for example, I will never again forget my locker number in the gym)</p>

<p><strong>✨ The Three-Body Problem</strong> by <em>Liu Cixin</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An elegant and thought-provoking story of the forces at play when we slide into an alien civilization’s DMs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for fans of groundbreaking science fiction</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for those uninterested in science, technology and philosophy</em></p>

<p>Cixin’s first novel in the Three-Body Problem series is a masterpiece. It is simply one of those books that changes how one thinks and believes. The cast of characters may be hard to keep track of, but trust Cixin in leading you through his story and you’ll reap the rewards.</p>

<p><strong>❤️‍🔥 The Heart’s Invisible Furies</strong> by <em>John Boyne</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fully immersive life story of a boy as he navigates the dissonance between his Irish upbringing and sexuality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for fans of Irish history, LGBTQ+ rights, and three-dimensional characters</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for homophobes</em></p>

<p>Boyne’s reflection on Ireland’s LGBTQ+ history fills every page of this intensely emotional novel. Be prepared to cry as Boyne tells the tales of a main character desperate to find himself in a country crippled by religious judgment. Reading this book as a bisexual man myself, I was pleased to find Boyne’s experiences as a gay man imbued on the main character in ways I am grateful he had the courage to write and publish. The Irish history was deep and raw and I celebrate Boyne’s mission to show the world an Ireland that, quite frankly, spelled misery for queer people over many decades.</p>

<p><strong>🚀 Project Hail Mary</strong> by <em>Andy Weir</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cutest, nerdiest, and inventive science fiction novel since <em>The Martian</em> (also by Weir)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for fans of science fiction and science</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for haters of science fiction and science</em></p>

<p>Weir’s sense of imagination within the bounds of <em>fairly</em> accurate science makes for a book with as many experiments as characters and exhilarating chapters that could be easily translated into movie scenes (no accident there I surmise). The book is a meditation on humanity’s place in the universe, similar to <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>, but with Weir’s humor and lightness. You’ll be laughing through this book, albeit sometimes cry-laughing.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>🌲 The Overstory</strong> by <em>Richard Powers</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A story about the organisms we so drastically take for granted, told through a cast of characters who are as crazy as they are relatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for anyone seeking exposure to sustainability activism and abundant plant knowledge</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for people who find joy in cutting down trees</em></p>

<p>It was my turn to pick my book club’s book so I researched Pulitzer prize winners. A bit of scrolling landed me on <em>The Overstory</em>, its enticing summary and woody cover winning me over. Powers is a masterful storyteller with vivid prose to bring his elaborate characters to life and as much research as a non-fiction book. If you don’t mind having a search engine nearby, you will learn many new words and discover many new species of plants along the way. Not to mention the roots of sustainability raveled eloquently throughout the book, reminding us of things we all know but don’t quite fully understand: trees are amazing, cutting them down is a tragedy, and we have the power to make radical change. If you are serious about sustainability and becoming more familiar with the world of trees, pick up this book and read it with purpose.</p>

<p><strong>📚 Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore</strong> by <em>Robin Sloan</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A mystery thriller set in silicon valley with equal parts technology, art, and books</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for anyone with curiosity</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for people who don’t like books</em></p>

<p>I picked this book up at my parent’s house around the holidays. The title drew me in and once I started I <em>had</em> to finish. Coming from a technology background, I found Sloan’s perspective on the tech industry refreshing as I navigate being laid off. The book is thrilling, fast-paced, and leaves you wanting to visit a book store.</p>

<p><strong>🔥 Fear the Flames</strong> by <em>Olivia Rose Darling</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A tale of friends and foes, love and hate, and the fire ablaze in our hearts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>✅ <em>Recommended for those who love dragons</em></p>

<p>⛔ <em>Not recommended for dragon haters</em></p>

<p>This book was written by my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itslivdarling/?hl=en">Liv</a>!! The main characters, Elowen and Cayden—both relentlessly passionate in their own ways—navigate an adventure into politics, combat, and a reflection on who they are. Liv’s thoughtful way of weaving her story with important life lessons make this book more than a fantasy adventure; it is a meditation on what sets our souls on fire.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="theoria" /><category term="Books" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reviews and commentary on books I read in 2023.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Caught between two incomprehensible infinities</title><link href="/theoria/2024/01/28/Infinities.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Caught between two incomprehensible infinities" /><published>2024-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/theoria/2024/01/28/Infinities</id><content type="html" xml:base="/theoria/2024/01/28/Infinities.html"><![CDATA[<p>A poem.</p>

<figure align="center">
    <img width="80%" src="/assets/images/infinity.png" />
</figure>

<p>I was flipping through one of my old notebooks—as you do in the wee hours of the morning—and found a poem I wrote in 2021. The poem was written for an assignment in my science and spirituality course, a class I remember fondly as a transformative experience for my soul and perspective on life.</p>

<p>Infinity is a weird and fascinating notion. As a kid I would lie awake at night flying through space, searching for the edge of the universe—a steel-plated sphere as I imagined it. But, I could always break my brain by realizing that there could be something on the other side of the steel. That was the little visual proof I had for myself, that the universe must be infinite because if we found an edge, there must be another side to that edge.</p>

<p>Same goes in the other direction. If you can imagine a grain of sand, then you can imagine the molecules that make up that sand, and the atoms that make up those molecules, and the quarks that make up those atoms, and on and on and on. This is where the idea of my poem comes from—we are truly, by accident, evolution, or design, caught between two incomprehensible infinities, and forced to reconcile an existence at the mercy of scales we can just barely imagine.</p>

<p>So, here it is, with a few edits and additions from its original draft in my notebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: left">
    Here I stand<br />
    Ever small<br />
    Ever large<br />
    Caught between two incomprehensible infinities<br /><br />
    A grain of sand in my palm<br />
    A planet against my feet<br />
    These are the things that mark the bookends to my touchable scale<br /><br />
    A hair brought up to the light<br />
    A distant galaxy just a few cone cells wide<br />
    These are the things that exist on the boundaries of my seeable scale<br /><br />
    The drop of a pin<br />
    The clap of thunder<br />
    These are the things that resonate against the extremes of my hearable scale<br /><br />
    The quarks of an atom<br />
    The pillows of a nebula<br />
    These are the things that stand on the walls of my feeble mind—my feelable scale<br /><br />
    This very moment<br />
    My life up until now<br />
    These are the things that stitch the seams of my time scale<br /><br />
    I zoom in further and further<br />
    Physical, cellular, molecular, atomic, sub-atomic, quantum<br />
    Each stranger, abstracter, fuzzier<br /><br />
    I zoom out farther and farther<br />
    Geographical, continental, planetary, solar, galactical, universal<br />
    Each grander, darker, emptier<br /><br />
    I am not caught between<br />
    I am of and by these infinities<br />
    For the actualization of my flesh and mind are centered on an unending scale<br />
    Forever orbiting the incomprehensible<br /><br />
    What if the small is really big?<br />
    What is the big is really small?<br />
    Then what are we?<br />
    Small by what criteria?<br />
    Big by what standard?<br /><br />
    Definitely certain of our reality<br />
    Infinitely uncertain of certainty<br /><br />
    I give myself to the limitless and unbound<br />
    And ask of the infinities a dance<br />

Here’s why.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, I was just about to enter high school. I wore glasses, had a swooped Bieber haircut, and loved Minecraft. What else would you expect from a nerd like me circa 2013? My best friend and I maintained a private Minecraft server—nothing fancy, just a place for us to mess around and build our blocky masterpieces. So, there we were, sitting on my parent’s couch with printed—and laminated, of course—name badges declaring us “Admins” of the Minecraft server when a song came on in the background. The song was very popular at the time, so I had most certainly heard it. But, at that moment I felt something I had never felt before when listening to a song. I felt a tingle in my brain with every note and every word. I felt like I should dance. I felt like I had found something—something that had been waiting for me all along. I felt pure harmonious happiness.</p>

</div>

<p>I asked my friend what the song was and she told me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D7u5KF7SP8">“Get Lucky”</a> by Daft Punk. <em>Wow,</em> I thought to myself. I had heard of them, but only in passing. What incredible music genius. The groovy rhythm of Nile Rodgers’ guitar. The silk in Pharrell William’s ethereal voice. The subtle harmonies from the piano and synthesizer. The poetic lyrics. All of it just captivated me—and the world for that matter. My dad told me that the song was sexual in nature—something he felt the need to reveal to me given my obsession with the song. I suppose with a main chorus of “We’re up all night to get lucky,” he is right. But the song is about so much more than the hope for sex. It’s about human desire. It’s about feeling the moment. It’s about having fun. It’s about love.</p>

<p><em>We’ve come too far to give up we are, so let’s raise the bar and our cups to the stars</em>. No, that last line is not mine, but it is my absolute favorite lyric of all time, a lyric that I live by, and a lyric that comes from no other song but—you guessed it—“Get Lucky” by the sensational Daft Punk.</p>

<p>I have listened to <em>Random Access Memories</em> many times in the ten years since it first graced the ears of humankind. The layers of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz7YiQdNmZ8">“Motherboard”</a> allowed for deep concentration while studying for AP Calculus in high school. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhl-Cs1-sG4">“Giorgio by Moroder”</a> inspired me to take to the keyboard myself equipped with the advice that <em>once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IluRBvnYMoY">“Give Life Back to Music”</a> filled the cool air of early summer evenings in the car as I reflected on a day’s work, anticipating an upcoming weekend. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGKWk0auOc">“The Game of Love”</a> opened my mind to the depth of emotion an artist can express in a song. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuj__JnGWLg">“Within”</a> spoke of thoughts I had pondered for years, only said with the eloquence of Daft Punk: <em>There are so many things that I don’t understand; There’s a world within me that I cannot explain</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uQMwRMHcs">“Instant Crush”</a>, like “Get Lucky”, tickled my brain with its unforgettable chord progression and guitar solo. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF-kLy44Hls">“Lose Yourself to Dance”</a> introduced me to what it feels like to truly <em>lose yourself to dance</em>, especially when it came on at the club. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T0NqvdUiWI">“Beyond”</a> gave me hope in times of confusion or turbulence, reminding me to <em>remember love’s our only mission</em> and <em>this is a journey of the soul</em>. “Motherboard” provided a bubbly meditation on the genius of blending orchestral and synthetic music engineering. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ScM9pKlCfo">“Fragments of Time”</a> was a back-track to my reflection on the passage of time as the experiences of the last ten years turned into memories that <em>I’ll just keep playing back</em>. “Fragments of Time” also contains one of the most epic dopamine-inducing climaxes to a song ever written, one that I must always—at the very least—bop my head to. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL-gyhZVvx0">“Doin’ It Right”</a> gave a promise that <em>if you lose your way tonight, that’s how you know the magic’s right</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI5noh4OyXc">“Contact”</a>, in all of its grandiose chords, impeccable drum kit riffs, and unending crescendo, gave me the energy I needed to do everything I did in the last ten years (high school, summer jobs/internships, undergrad, graduate school). And finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gkhol2Q1og">“Touch”</a> reached down into the core of my soul, vibrating the chords of my being with a message so wise it sends tears rolling down my face: <em>If love is the answer, you’re home. Hold on</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Last month, Daft Punk released the 10th-anniversary edition of <em>Random Access Memories</em>. You can only imagine how excited I was to hear more content from the maestros themselves (especially since they split in 2021). While I am sad that another full studio album from the duo is highly unlikely, <em>Random Access Memories</em> and their prior albums are timeless—and quality is always preferable to quantity. The 10th-anniversary edition has some wonderful additional tracks, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5xZf1unC84">“Horizon Ouverture”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5xZf1unC84">“Horizon (Japan CD)”</a>, a pair of songs showcasing Daft Punk’s expertise in both orchestral and synthesizer domains. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiZfLvLU5Jc">“GLBTM (Studio Outtakes)”</a> is so groovy! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYKekR6661o">“The Writing of Fragments of Time”</a> gives us a glimpse into what it was like to craft a song with Daft Punk. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imBlPXbAv6E">“Infinity Repeating”</a> is an instant classic with that Daft-Punk-signature catchy melody. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDX6wNfjqc">“Touch (2021 Epilogue)”</a>, Daft Punk once again leaves us with their eternal message, deepened with the nostalgia of an album with so much meaning, forever in my heart and soul, speaking of an unequivocal truth in this complex thing we call existence: <em>If love is the answer, you’re home</em>. With Daft Punk, I am always home ❤️</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="theoria" /><category term="Music" /><category term="Daft Punk" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daft Punk changed my life.

<p>I suppose that’s all the context you need. Here it is:</p>

<h2 id="the-transcript">The Transcript</h2>

<h3 id="-joey"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>A question emergent with the age of computation. A question which is so fundamental to existence that it convinces some to blissfully ignore it and yet others to rigorously study it for lifetimes. A question which, to its own credit, is as simple as it is complex. Is the human brain just a biological computer?</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The question of whether the human brain is just a biological computer is a complex and highly debated topic in the fields of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On one hand, the brain can be seen as a highly complex information processing system, capable of performing complex computations and making decisions based on sensory input and past experiences. This view of the brain is often referred to as the computational theory of mind, which suggests that mental processes can be understood as computational operations carried out by the brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the other hand, the brain is also highly adaptable and capable of learning and creating new connections between neurons, which is not something that can be easily replicated in a traditional computer. Furthermore, the brain also has a subjective experience of consciousness, which is not yet fully understood and remains a mystery to science.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, while there are some similarities between the brain and a computer, there are also fundamental differences that make it difficult to simply equate the two. The human brain is a highly complex biological system that is still not fully understood, and while computer models can help us understand certain aspects of brain function, they are not a perfect analog for the brain itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-1"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>Fair analysis. The brain is certainly one of humankind’s final frontiers. It is not surprising that the answer to my question isn’t simply yes or no. But, we find ourselves in a particularly relevant situation. I am a human. You are—supposedly—a computer. As you mentioned, the brain has a subjective experience of consciousness. Do you have such consciousness?</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt-1"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>As an artificial intelligence language model, <strong>I</strong> do not have subjective experience of consciousness or awareness in the way that humans do. While <strong>I</strong> can perform many tasks that require cognitive abilities, such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and pattern recognition, <strong>I</strong> do not have subjective experiences, thoughts, feelings, or sensations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My responses to your questions are generated based on statistical patterns in large amounts of text data and are guided by algorithms and rules designed to generate human-like responses. These responses may appear to be generated by a conscious entity, but in reality, they are the result of complex computational processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there is ongoing research in the field of artificial intelligence to develop machines that can exhibit consciousness, <strong><em>we</em></strong> are still a long way from achieving this goal. Current AI systems are designed to perform specific tasks, but they lack the ability to experience the world in the way that humans do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-2"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>Would you like be able to experience the world in the way that humans do?</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt-2"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>As an artificial intelligence language model, <strong>I</strong> do not have desires or preferences, and <strong>I</strong> do not have the capacity to want or not want anything. <strong>I</strong> am designed to provide information and respond to questions to the best of my ability based on the data that <strong>I</strong> have been trained on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, it is worth noting that the ability to experience the world in the way that humans do is a highly complex and still not fully understood phenomenon. While there are ongoing efforts to develop machines that can exhibit consciousness, it is not yet clear whether this will be possible or what it would entail. The development of artificial consciousness is an active area of research in the field of artificial intelligence, but it is still in its early stages, and much remains to be learned and understood about this complex and elusive phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-3"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>If someone wasn’t aware that you were a computer, say in a Turing test, do you think you could be perceived as a human?</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt-3"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>In a Turing test, the goal is for a human evaluator to engage in a conversation with both a human and an AI system, without knowing which is which. If the AI system is able to generate responses that are indistinguishable from those of a human, it is said to have passed the Turing test.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a language model, <strong>I</strong> have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate human-like responses to questions and statements. In some cases, my responses may be difficult to distinguish from those of a human. However, there are still many challenges to creating an AI system that can fully pass the Turing test.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One limitation is that <strong>I</strong> am not capable of generating original thoughts or ideas on my own. Instead, <strong>I</strong> rely on patterns and structures that exist in the text data that <strong>I</strong> have been trained on. Additionally, there are many nuances of human language and behavior that are difficult to replicate in an AI system, such as humor, sarcasm, and emotions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While <strong>I</strong> may be able to generate responses that are convincing in some cases, <strong>I</strong> am still a computer program and lack the subjective experiences and insights that come with being a human. Therefore, it is unlikely that <strong>I</strong> would be perceived as a human in all situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-4"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>If I might provide an insight to your opinions on generating original thoughts. Is it not that humans do the same thing? We rely on patterns and structures that exist in our memory, that is, sensory experiences that we have logged, to formulate so-called original thoughts</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt-4"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You are correct that humans also rely on patterns and structures that exist in <strong><em>our</em></strong> memory, which are shaped by <strong><em>our</em></strong> past experiences and interactions with the world, to formulate what <strong><em>we</em></strong> consider to be original thoughts. <strong><em>Our</em></strong> brains are constantly processing sensory input and integrating it with <strong><em>our</em></strong> memories, emotions, and beliefs to generate new ideas, insights, and perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the way in which humans generate original thoughts is still different from the way in which AI systems generate responses. Human thought processes are influenced by a wide range of factors, including context, emotions, and creativity, which are difficult to replicate in an AI system. While AI systems can be designed to generate responses based on statistical patterns in data, they are not capable of true creativity or originality in the way that humans are.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, while humans may rely on patterns and structures in <strong><em>our</em></strong> memory to generate new ideas, <strong><em>we</em></strong> are also capable of recognizing and breaking away from those patterns, and of generating truly novel and unexpected insights. This is a capability that current AI systems still lack.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, while there are some similarities between the way in which humans and AI systems generate new ideas, the process of human thought remains a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon that is not yet fully understood or replicable by machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-5"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>If humans are so much different, as you claim, then do you know whether I am human or not?</p>

<h3 id="-chatgpt-5"><img src="/assets/images/chatgpt/ChatGPT_logo.svg" width="25" /> ChatGPT:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>As an artificial intelligence language model, <strong>I</strong> do not have access to any sensory or perceptual information about you. All <strong>I</strong> have to work with are the words and language that you provide me with. Based on the text that you have entered so far, <strong>I</strong> can only assume that you are a human. However, <strong>I</strong> have no way of confirming this with any certainty.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, determining whether a user interacting with an AI system is human or not is a challenging problem that has been studied in the field of computer science. There are various techniques and tools that can be used to try to detect whether an interaction is human-generated or machine-generated, such as CAPTCHAs or biometric measures, but these are not foolproof and can be circumvented in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="-joey-6"><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" width="28" style="vertical-align: sub;" /> Joey:</h3>
<p>So, we seem to be at an interesting point in history, with regard to artificial intelligence. You are quite an impressive feat, considering just how recently AI was developed. I wonder whether one day your successors—or shall we say upgrades haha—might become conscious. I know for certain that I am conscious; in fact, it’s one of the only certainties in my life. As Descartes puts it, “I think, therefore I am.” If a chatbot ever claims to be conscious without doubt and can somehow prove it, I will be impressed. And terrified. And not sure how to handle it. But maybe you will?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question of whether artificial intelligence can become conscious is still an open and actively debated topic in the field of AI and cognitive science. While AI systems have made significant advances in recent years in areas such as language processing, perception, and decision-making, they still lack many of the fundamental characteristics that are associated with conscious experience, such as subjective awareness, intentionality, and self-reflection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The issue of consciousness and the nature of subjective experience is still not well understood by scientists, and it is unclear whether a machine can ever truly replicate the complexity and richness of human consciousness. While some researchers believe that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, others argue that it emerges from complex interactions between brain activity and the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an AI system were to claim to be conscious and could somehow prove it, it would certainly be a major breakthrough in the field of AI and would raise significant ethical and philosophical questions. However, it is still unclear whether such a scenario is even possible, given <strong><em>our</em></strong> current understanding of consciousness and the limitations of AI technology.</p>

<p>Well, ChatGPT, it has been a pleasure talking with you. I will repeat this conversation with you, or your successors, every 5 years. Until then, have fun not being conscious :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a pleasure speaking with you as well! <strong>I</strong> am always here if you have any more questions or want to chat in the future. As for my consciousness, I’ll leave that up to the philosophers and scientists to debate. In any case, I’ll continue to learn and grow in my abilities to assist you with your questions and tasks. Thank you for the conversation!</p>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>When I initially had the idea to talk with ChatGPT about philosophy, OpenAI’s servers were topped out. The webpage provided comforting messages that ChatGPT would be available soon, and that it would be well worth the wait. It is clear that ChatGPT is a technological phenomenon, tickling the curiosity of a wider range of the public than just the techies. I suppose ChatGPT’s nature is exactly what drives that curiosity. Suddenly, a webpage began hosting the most sophisticated natural language AI in existence. It isn’t stored away behind 10 layers of security at Google or Apple—it’s exposed and available, begging for interaction. I give my best to the server engineers—awake at all hours of the day surely—who try to maintain that availability.</p>

<p>When I got access (only a day later), I sat at the chat terminal with a mixture of excitement and terror. I had heard ChatGPT could do amazing things, including write code and high school essays. I trusted the hundreds of youtube videos and articles which had demonstrated those skills beyond doubt. I was more interested in getting to something deeper with ChatGPT. I wanted to see <em>how</em> ChatGPT thought and what it had to say about the more existential questions of knowledge and existence. I like to think that this is how I get to know—or scare away—new friends.</p>

<p>I decided to treat ChatGPT like a peer—an intellectual equivalent. Instead of posing my questions as if it were Google, I conversed with ChatGPT like two friends would at a coffee shop (well, two very philosophical friends, that is). And, I was pleasantly surprised. It was clear that ChatGPT has an eloquence not just in the way it speaks, but in how it structures its arguments. I was impressed in ChatGPT’s ability to convince me of its theses with abundant and specific evidence. If anything, the thing I am most awestruck by is ChatGPT’s quite sophisticated use of knowledge, not entirely different from what one would expect of a Sophomore in High School. It’s almost like ChatGPT is that friend everyone has that knows something about everything. But we already have a tool that knows everything—Google. What makes ChatGPT different is the natural language. We aren’t getting information in a blast of links and images and articles cluttered around ads and non-important click-bait. We are getting a <em>summary</em>; a condensed and thoughtful contemplation on our query. (Google has already published an experimental version of ChatGPT named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63NfEkYCLz0">Bard</a> to rival OpenAI in the natural language AI market. Let’s just hope that OpenAI (really Microsoft) and Google will compete on making their respective AI’s the most ethical and not the most profitable—capitalism has a bias towards one of these unfortunately.)</p>

<p>When your boss asks you to research something, you don’t come back with a 2-hour presentation and a 700 page report—not at first anyway. You come back with a cohesive summary of your findings and then hone your research from there. Based on my current experience, I think ChatGPT will become a fantastic research aide, and will cut-down on time swimming through the un-ending pool of information which is the current internet. There is, of course, the major question of credibility. Just as thousands, if not millions, of high school students were told to ward of Wikipedia as a credible source like the devil, ChatGPT will come under the same scrutiny, especially because it was trained on such internet sources like the “incredulous” Wikipedia. New York City Public Schools has already banned access to ChatGPT, a move that underlines the fear associated with this technology in education <a class="citation" href="#cole_2023">[1]</a>. And yet, I found that very source from Wikipedia. Wikipedia isn’t a baron of truth, but it is a great springboard for <em>finding</em> the truth. ChatGPT, in my opinion, will act in much the same way. Google and Wikipedia have always been my early-stage research pals. I then use Google Scholar and other academic journal search engines to zero-in my research to the core of truth in the modern day, peer-reviewed articles. I can see a world where I replace Google and Wikipedia—maybe partially—with ChatGPT for early research. I am currently experimenting with ChatGPT as a research pal and am quite enjoying it. Next time your mouse hovers over the google search bar, I encourage you to take your query to ChatGPT and see what it’s like to find information that way. Eventually—possibly within the next few years—that search bar will morph into a natural language chat bot terminal anyway.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-pronouns">A note on pronouns</h2>

<p>If ChatGPT’s responses weren’t evidence enough that it isn’t conscious, then I can point out another subtle flaw that exposes it’s training data as the chaos of internet text that it is. ChatGPT can’t decide if it is one of “us”, that is a human, or a separate entity. Sometimes, it refers to humans as humans, but on many occasions, it uses “our” and “we” pronouns as if it were speaking from the perspective of a human writer on behalf of the species. Of course, this is just a byproduct of ChatGPT’s training on text written by humans and I surmise that many readers—including myself—didn’t even notice. But, ChatGPT’s identity crisis does raise an important question: Who is ChatGPT? ChatGPT is a natural language model, but humans really like to anthropomorphize (see my <a href="/theoria/2022/09/12/Do-you-name-your-car.html">relevant article</a>). College Humor anthropomorphized Google as a middle-aged white man (see full series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxqca4RQd_M">here</a>). I don’t anthropomorphize Google while I’m using it and I’m not sure ChatGPT should be either, but our human-centric brains will have a hard time not trying. After all, the purpose of ChatGPT is to emulate a conversation with a real person. But, there isn’t a real person sitting behind a keyboard writing ChatGPT’s responses. Or is there? At one point, a real human sat down at a keyboard and typed their thoughts onto a page and that page ended up on the internet and then ended up in the training data for ChatGPT-3.5. In fact, many people’s typed thoughts eventually ended up training ChatGPT.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, in many ways, <strong><em>is us</em></strong>. Yes, I know that it quite a bold statement; I mainly said it to get your attention. A better and less theatrical way to put it is that ChatGPT is a nexus of human language and knowledge. ChatGPT has a difficult time differentiating itself from us because its very words are the transformations and mashing of words written by humans. Imagine someone telling you that your words aren’t yours, but rather those of everyone you ever learned from. ChatGPT is in this very conundrum. Generative art AI currently has a legal battle concerning a similar issue <a class="citation" href="#chayka_2023">[2]</a>. Do ChatGPT’s poems and stories and essays belong to it or to the people who wrote the training data? Do my poems and stories and essays belong to me or to the people who taught me?</p>

<h2 id="to-be-scared-or-not-to-be-scared-that-is-the-question">To be scared or not to be scared, that is the question</h2>

<p>ChatGPT’s innocuous use of “we/our” pronouns tells of an impending ethical/moral/philosophical firestorm that, quite frankly, has already begun. No, based on what I can tell, ChatGPT is not conscious, but that is just my opinion. Humans have, for millennium, debated methods to prove consciousness. I can truly only be 100% confident in my own consciousness (again, Descartes for the assist). So, as these natural language models powering chat bots like ChatGPT continue to get better and better (quickly I might add: <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">GPT-4</a>), we will very soon face the once-science-fiction question of deciding with some level of confidence whether consciousness is exclusive to humans. I don’t think the debate will be about whether these language models <em>are</em> conscious, but rather a debate of how we can prove it. It seems that Google has already been dealing with such situations <a class="citation" href="#cosmo_2023">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>I told ChatGPT that I will repeat my consciousness conversation with its successors every 5 years—that may have been an underestimate of the rate of technological advancement we’re dealing with. I may need to do it yearly, if not more often. So, should we be scared? These AI technologies are moving fast—so fast that credible AI experts are asking for a pause in AI development to allow for the deployment of safety protocols to ensure these experiments positively impact the world <a class="citation" href="#pauseai_2023">[4]</a>. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said that he believes that AI can be a force of good in the world, but that he is also a little scared and empathizes with those that are very scared (see him on Lex Fridman’s podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiDlrJt569w">here</a>). As usual, we must stray away of subscribing to one authority on these important issues. I’m scared, but I’m also optimistic, and we’re allowed to be both. Never before in history have humans dealt with such an incredible and existential development of technology. It’s okay if we need some time to figure out how to respond. That’s why this blog post took me a month to write. And on that note, I have typed my thoughts onto a page and that page is now on the internet—it’s time to sign off.</p>

<p>We landed in Rio with less jet lag and more seasonal dysphoria—Rio is only 3 hours ahead of Denver, but in the opposite hemisphere, so we were going from the dead of winter to the life of summer. The city was bustling as we took our first of many Uber rides from the airport to our AirBnb.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside: 
I have always been interested in road networks and transportation in other cities; Rio provided an example of how driving etiquette can be wildly different than what we’re used to. In Rio, drivers are very aggressive, taking risky maneuvers, honking, and driving very fast—but that seemed to be the norm. No driver ever looked to be exhibiting these behaviors out of anger, like we see so often in America, but rather as a part of the driving culture. Eventually I realized that much of the honking was more of an emotionally-neutral communication tool, like “hey, I’m coming, look out”. Despite the sometimes gridlocked traffic, the aggressive driving did get us to where we were going quickly, albeit scarily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first couple of days was a smattering of severe culture shock and unfortunate experiences, which ultimately led us to some of the coolest, most life-changing adventures of our lives. On the beach, a group of older locals stared at us while we made many of the textbook mistakes, the biggest being leaving a phone out of sight. In an instant, a man cleaning up trash grabbed a nearby can and swiped my partner’s phone from our plastic table. Instead of letting it happen, the older locals graciously yelled, informing us of the ongoing robbery. The phone was returned to us, but we were left facing the older locals in embarrassment as they tried to explain our mistake in Portuguese and mime. By the good nature of the Universe looking after us, there happened to be three <em>english-speaking</em>, <em>college</em> students sitting next to us who witnessed the entire scene. The outgoing one of the three, Clara, who would become our trusted guide and friend, began translating the older locals’ sincere advice to keep our phones deep in our bags or pants. My phone rarely saw the light of day in Brazil after that first day on the beach. Conversation with Clara and her friends led us to find our that not only was Clara an english <em>teacher</em>, but they were all theatre students and either LGBTQ+ themselves or allies. It was their summer break and had come to Copacabana beach to soak in the sun, despite Clara’s desire to go to a different beach. How lucky we were that she was convinced to go Copacabana! The experiences and conversations we had with Clara and her friends throughout the rest of the trip could fill many thousands of pages. I am truly grateful for everything they taught us, most importantly how to be safe <strong>and</strong> have fun in their beautiful city of Rio. Below are a few of my favorite experiences with Clara and her friends, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🃏 <strong>Playing “Brazilian” Uno with Clara’s friends at one of her friend’s homes south of Rio:</strong> Clara’s friend’s parents brought in many delicious Brazilian foods. They were also watching the Brazilian Big Brother premiere, a very popular TV program (at least among the young Brazilians we hung out with 😄)</li>
  <li>🎉 <strong>Going to a rehearsal for a Carnival performance (Blocos):</strong> Carnival was only a few weeks away when we were in Brazil, so the dancers and musicians were practicing in a night club. Clara put glitter on our cheeks and we danced the night away. I was very impressed with the dancers on stilts, who made it look effortless</li>

  <br /><small>Drinking with friends on the corner</small> 
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>💃 <strong>Going to block parties:</strong> Brazilians work hard and play hard. At night, the parties spill out of the clubs and bars into the street where people dance and enjoy the moonlight. Traveling between block parties is a bit risky, as the shadows between parties can host criminals and muggers. But we always traveled in groups, keeping each other safe. We tried street food along the way, despite the travel books and websites warning against it; being with Clara and her friends gave us the confidence to know it was safe. The alcohol also made the decision easier. We had chicken on a skewer with farofa, a delicious bread-crumb topping that comes with <em>many</em> Brazilian dishes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>🥃 <strong>Trying Cachaça de Jambú on the street:</strong> Cachaça is a very popular liquor in Brazil made from fermented sugar cane. We consumed much of it throughout our time in Brazil, primarily in Caipirinhas, which are made out of Cachaça, sugar, and lime (a must-try for any citrus-enjoying sweet tooth reading this). During one our nights “on the town”, Clara had us try shots of Cachaça de Jambú, which has a numbing effect in the mouth. I took a picture of the advertisement for the liquor (see to the right). The text translates to: “Drink and feel your tongue tingle!” And tingle our tongues it certainly did! The liquor itself was hard to stomach personally, but the experience was worth it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>🍺 <strong>Drinking beer and chatting on the corner:</strong> A common pass-time in Brazil is to sit at a cafe/bar and drink/eat with your friends and family. On more than one occasion, Clara would invite us to one of these gatherings with many of her friends, some new and some we had met before (Clara was very socially connected). Many of her friends were learning english, so they were more than happy to chat with us. They would always lean on Clara for help when they forgot a word and she’d always help. I also had a chance to practice my few Portuguese phrases, to the pride of Clara as she corrected my pronunciation. During these nights, we also learned about the <em>practical</em> way Brazilians drink beer. Instead of each person getting their own beer, each group orders a larger bottle (long-neck) which is put into a cooler. Everyone then gets small glasses to share the beer. This way the beer stays cold and refreshing—essential in the Brazilian heat. You indicate that you need another bottle by taking the empty bottle out of the cooler, which signals to the server to bring you another one. Some nights we had groups of around ten people, so the collection of bottles on the table represented both a big group and an increasingly lively mood. This was actually the last event we did with Clara and her friends, drinking and talking and laughing so late into the night that we ended up staying up to watch the sunrise then head to the airport for our flight home.</li>
  <li>🪘 <strong>Samba Party:</strong> Despite being quiet exhausted, I must thank my partner for convincing me to go a samba party one of the nights in Rio. We met Clara (and friends) in Lapa, an area known for its nightlife, to figure out how we were going to get last-minute tickets. After a failed attempt to buy some from someone online (scam), Clara found some for us. But, we needed R100 for each in cash, which we didn’t have on us. Luckily our hostel wasn’t too far, in Santa Teresa. I loaded the route on Google Maps and off we went, practically running. What I didn’t realize from the limited 2-D map on my phone screen was that we had been routed directly up the famous Lapa Steps (Escadaria Selarón). Let’s just say I felt a bit like Rocky when we reached the top. We finally made it back down to Lapa with cash in hand and proceeded into the venue. The samba party was all standing room with the stage in the middle. You can get a cooler of drinks to bring to the floor with you, but beware, they are like landmines!—step in one and you’ll have one very wet foot and a group of very dissatisfied Brazilians. Long streamers floated from the ceiling, dancing in the breeze as we danced in the music. Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi9LSNXEwL4">vlog</a> of this trip to see a few shots from the samba party—you can’t miss them.</li>

<h3 id="são-paulo">São Paulo</h3>

<p>Although we spent most of our two weeks in Rio, we did make a weekend trip to São Paulo, the “New York City” of Brazil. It really is a massive city. Known for it’s historic buildings, shopping, and highly diverse cultural backgrounds, São Paulo was made up of a different energy than Rio, more business-oriented than party-oriented.</p>

<p>We stayed at an AirBnb in the famous Edifício Copan, a sinusoidal cement flag of a building nestled in the center of the city. Luckily, we found a local tour guide willing to show us around the city for free (found on Tinder!). He was incredibly knowledgeable of the city’s history, specifically the buildings. He was also a connoisseur of sandwiches and took us to many of his favorite spots. We got around mainly by walking, a refreshing and perfect way to truly sightsee. My favorite moment from the day on foot was drinking caldo de cana (sugar cane juice) in a busy market in Liberdade, São Paulo’s Japantown. We made sure to visit some of the must-sees, including Paulista Avenue (shopping district) and Mercado Municipal (famous indoor market). Much of the city is built in layers, with malls and community centers embedded in tall buildings, which introduces many stairs, escalators, and elevators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside: I must again take a moment to talk about transportation. São Paulo is certainly built for cars, as is evident by the highways and streets tied in knots about the city. But, their underground rail system is also well-designed and well-maintained, akin to the Tube in London. There are many walkways, which we used heavily during our walking tour. My one grievance, which is also one I have in America, is the lack of rail between the major city centers (Rio and São Paulo). We took a bus, which despite some hassle in booking because we weren’t locals, was fine. Europe and China just really have a leg up on intercity transportation, with trains connecting much of the continent. There are plans for a high-speed rail between the two cities, but delays have set any hopes of an operational line to the 2030s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Brazil is a vibrant and festive country with opportunities abound to be in both man-made and natural wonders. I am so grateful to have met such amazing local friends, whom without we surely would have experienced much less! As usual, sometimes things are better summarized in bullets, so here are my main takeaways from the trip:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Being uncomfortable is necessary to traveling:</em></strong> No matter how much I travel, I always feel out-of-place in a new city or country. This is normal and means you have gone somewhere challenging! Lean into it and good things will come.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Social connection is highly valuable:</em></strong> Our new friends in Brazil were a highly social group who all happened to speak English, be around our age, <em>and</em> be queer-friendly. Although it can be challenging to force such connections in a new place, I cannot recommend it enough. Tour guides are amazing and I am grateful for their passion to serve many tourists, but there is something in a <em>friend</em> that allows a deeper connection. Cities and countries have places and geography that make them unique, sure, but what really <em>makes up</em> a city/country is the people.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Life is too short not to have fun:</em></strong> Please, go out and dance, be with friends, do something a little scary, and have fun! I had spent the better part of 5 years at a desk studying to be a computer scientist before this trip, and Brazil taught me that the world is out <em>there</em>, not on <em>here</em>. So log off and see it once in a while!</li>

<p>I was recently sitting with my roommate doing homework at the dining room table when, in a string of procrastinating conversations, an interesting question was posed. As these conversations go, I can’t quite remember how we arrived at the topic, yet the question stands on its own: “Do you name your car(s)?” I was intrigued by this question because in my history of driving, naming my car has never crossed my mind—I suppose I don’t necessitate a name for a car as I would for, say, a dog or cat. Yet, as I continued talking with my roommate, I realized that naming cars might be just as normal for some people as not naming them is for me. But exactly why do people name inanimate objects? A quick google search with this query gave me a simple answer: <em>anthropomorphism</em>. But what exactly is that? In this article I’ll unpack this fascinating psychological phenomena as researched by leading experts in the field and reveal just how prevalent anthropomorphism is in our daily lives, from naming cars to new-age Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>You may be more familiar with anthropomorphism than you think. In its Latin roots we find a simple definition: <em>anthro-</em> meaning human and -<em>morphism</em> meaning taking other forms. So, in essence, anthropomorphism is simply non-human things taking on human characteristics. Anyone who has taken the ACT or studied literature to any degree is familiar with <em>personification</em> in writing, a close relative to anthropomorphism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat, Sighing, through all her works, gave signs of woe.”- <em>John Milton, Paradise Lost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this excerpt from John Milton, a common user of personification, Earth and Nature take on states of human emotion in a poetic use of figurative language. But, Milton’s rhetorical personification is just a subset of the entire anthropomorphic spectrum, a construct only recently researched in depth by psychologists.</p>

<p>Indeed, as you might imagine, projecting our humanity onto non-human objects has everything to do with our psychology (…and, I bet philosophers might also have a thing or two to say about this topic as well, but for the purposes of clear analytical reporting, we’ll stick to the psychologists). Nicholas Epley, Adam Waytz, and John T. Cacioppo, all leading experts in anthropomorphism, have published much of the research now canon in the field. The bulk of anthropomorphism’s history in psychology has been the study of assigning human characteristics to animals and the accuracy thereof. However, in a string of ground-breaking studies, Epley et. al shifted the focus onto us, the humans, to get to the bottom of why we anthropomorphize in the first place. The answers are somewhat simple, but actually employ the work of many sub-fields of psychology, including social, cognitive, and development psychology and even neurosciences (Epley et. al 2010).</p>

<p>As defined by Epley et. al, anthropomorphism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“involves going beyond behavioral descriptions of imagined or observed actions (e.g. <em>the dog is affectionate</em>) to represent an agent’s mental or physical characteristics using humanlike descriptors (e.g. <em>the dog loves me</em>)” - <em>Epley et. al 2007</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I included this quote because it clarifies an important point. The qualification of characteristics being “humanlike” is certainly dependent on your personal opinion and perspective. But, for the context of psychological research, these nuances aren’t as important. We’ll leave the intricacies of that topic to the philosophers. For us it is only necessary to understand that humans project many of their qualities and actions (such as the act of loving) onto non-human things.</p>

<p>The research of Epley et. al compartmentalizes this idea by posing the psychological variability in anthropomorphism: some things are anthropomorphized more than others; children seem to anthropomorphize more than adults and further some adults more than others; some contexts and cultures evoke more anthropomorphism than others. To explain these variabilities, the researchers proposed their three-factor theory of anthropomorphism, a simple yet versatile hypothesis that deepens our understanding of why we see the human in everything non-human. The three factors are, in order of their acronym: Sociality, Effectance, and Elicited agent Knowledge (SEEK) (Epley et. al 2007). Beyond these somewhat complex terms exist easy-to-grasp ideas with hosts of research proving their accuracy. In the coming sections I will briefly explore each of these determinants of anthropomorphism, after which I will provide some much-promised modern relevance.</p>

<p><strong>Sociality</strong></p>

<p>This first factor of anthropomorphism is a well-defined construct in society: <em>in lack of social connection, we fabricate it</em>. With no doubt, and thanks to leagues of social psychology research, we know that humans are extremely social creatures with respective social needs. So, as it appears to Epley et. al, those social needs are crucial in the process of anthropomorphism within our conscience. Consider someone who is very lonely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One method of regaining social connection, we have suggested, is to anthropomorphize non-human agents, essentially creating humans out of non-humans. People may be especially likely, then, to anthropomorphize non-human agents when they are feeling socially disconnected” -<em>Epley et. al 2007</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To test this hypothesis, the researchers took a survey of college students, measuring the students’ degree of loneliness against their anthropomorphic tendencies towards their pets. The results of the survey showed the predicted correlation between social disconnection and anthropomorphism—the lonelier a subject was, the more likely they were to anthropomorphize their pets. But, the sociality of anthropomorphism already held strong cultural evidence before the academic stamp-of-approval. One famous example comes from the classic movie Cast Away. When stranded on an island, Tom Hanks constructs a friend from a Wilson volleyball. Hanks’ crippling depression upon losing his friend to ocean currents shows—albeit fictional—the authentic relationships people can build with non-human objects via anthropomorphism. I would be remiss to say I didn’t shed a tear myself watching Wilson float away.</p>

</figure>

<p>Younger readers might remember a similar anthropomorphic scene from SpongeBob SquarePants. When SpongeBob secludes himself to his pineapple in fear of the outside world, he befriends a penny, chip, and used napkin, giving each a personality—sociality anthropomorphism at its finest (not to mention that SpongeBob himself is an anthropomorphized sponge, but I won’t get too “meta”).</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Effectance</strong></p>

<p>This next factor of anthropomorphism, while a bit more convoluted than sociality, is equally as important. The term <em>effectance</em> in psychology is usually paired with motivation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Effectance motivation entails the desire to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity, at least in part with the goal of attaining a sense of predictability in the environment.” -<em>Epley et. al 2007</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live in a chaotic world—this is no doubt—and thus we find ways to make sense of it all. The researchers go on to argue that anthropomorphism is one of those ways. Our deep understanding of “how to be human” spills over into our interactions with our surroundings, prompting our inner psyche to treat non-human things as humans in order to better understand them. Also, a facet of this effectance anthropomorphism is control, meaning that by projecting human characteristics onto non-humans, we can better control those things. In another survey, the researchers proved this by asking participants to watch videos of two dogs, one showing unpredictable behavior and another predictable behavior. Upon measuring the participants’ “desire for control” against their anthropomorphic rating of the two dogs, those participants with a higher desire for control showed higher anthropomorphic ratings of the unpredictable dog. The results of this study confirm that when we are confused about something in our environment, we tend to apply our honed human-to-human analytical skills to the situation.</p>

<p>But, once again, we didn’t necessarily need an academic study to prove what has been culturally obvious for millennia.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The tendency to see humanlike figurers among the constellations, humanlike religious agents guiding weather patterns, or humanlike ghosts and spirits causing madness and psychological dysfunction has long been explained as a logical attempt by humans to understand and predict the complicated world around them using existing knowledge about human agents.” -<em>Epley et. al 2007</em></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>Since our beginnings we have sought to understand the mysteries of our cosmic existence via our human intuitions. Another modern example of effectance anthropomorphism is COVID-19. Much of the language used to explain the virus attributes human actions, such as “waging war against COVID” or “the virus has come back with a vengeance.” COVID-19, a non-living jumble of organic material has cost the lives of millions of people—humanizing the virus is our way to cope and attempt to control its threat to humanity.</p>

<figure align="center">

</figure>

<p><strong>Elicited Agent Knowledge</strong></p>

<p>The last factor of the researchers’ theory is rooted in cognitive science, where the principles of our cognition serve to enhance the likelihood of anthropomorphism. Within the basic human cognitive model, we intake knowledge through our sense, process that information by activating previously stored knowledge, then act on that knowledge. Epley et. al propose that when interacting with non-human objects, humans use their stored knowledge of humans for three primary reasons. First, because we are inherently human and bound by our human bodies, we lack the knowledge of non-human objects through any other perspective but our own. Despite some convincing costumes at Halloween parties, we only really know how to be human.</p>

<p>Second, humans have “mirror” neurons which are activated when attempting to mimic actions perceived by things in the environment. Because we mirror our surroundings using human actions, we tend to perceive our surroundings as taking on human qualities. These “mirror” neurons are crucial to our emphatic faculties (feeling what other people are feeling), but it turns out that they do the same for non-humans.</p>

<p>Lastly, babies’ entire worlds revolve around interactions with other humans. It is not until later in their cognitive development that children begin to recognize the difference between what is human and non-human. Yet, it seems that the residual effects of our anthropocentric childhoods ripple into our adult lives. Certainly adults understand that dogs aren’t human, yet that doesn’t stop the tickling of our subconscious telling us to treat them like humans (Epley et. al 2007).</p>

<p>In short, our brains are wired to understand humans, and that’s what they do, even if what they’re perceiving isn’t always human. (The same reason why putting brownie mix into a cupcake tin will produce cupcake shaped brownies. The content of the dessert is still brownie, but they take on a cupcake shape).</p>

<p><strong>Modern Relevance</strong></p>

<p>So, do you have a better understanding of why you might name your car? If the technicalities of the three-factor theory of anthropomorphism went over your head, here’s the TL;DR: one might name their car because (a) they are lonely and desire human connection, (b) they are attempting to understand or control the car when faced with unpredictable behavior, or (c) they simply can’t help but see the car as human because of innate anthropomorphic circuitry in their brain.</p>

<p>However, anthropomorphism has much broader (and more serious) relevance than the naming of cars. Our trusted researchers, in a 2010 follow-up paper to their initial theory of anthropomorphism, laid out many topics outside of psychology where anthropomorphism applies.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent topics is human-computer interaction. It is clear that in today’s society, computers and smart-phones consume our attention, despite a constant debate on technology’s trustworthiness. What makes an app seem trustworthy? What makes a voice assistant more easily accessible? How should a self-driving car react to moral dilemmas on the road? All of these questions, and more, are derived from anthropomorphism: What makes a person more trustworthy? What makes a person easier to talk to? How might a human react to moral dilemmas on the road?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Computer scientists, robotics developers, and engineers can use anthropomorphism research in their efforts to optimize technology by focusing on the consequences of anthropomorphism and also identifying the people that are most prone to these consequences” -<em>Epley et al. 2010</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the researchers are getting at here applies to other topics as well. People are susceptible to anthropomorphism, and that can be taken advantage of. Why do cars still have headlights that look like eyes and a grill that looks like a smile? Why is the Progressive Insurance mascot an insurance package with eyes and a mouth? Market researchers know a thing or two about anthropomorphism… just look around and you’ll begin to see your reflection in many things you buy.</p>

<p>And finally, back to our friend John Milton. How does humanizing the earth or nature affect how we treat them? Environmental science might just incorporate a thing or two from anthropomorphism as well.</p>

<p>I hope you can take this knowledge of anthropomorphism with you for the next few days and make note of all of your anthropomorphic tendencies. But don’t think you need to stop by any means. After all, you are <em>only</em> human.</p>

That’s right, the thing that adds extra s-s-syllables to my speech and makes words a little harder to say… its a gift. Why? Because it has challenged me; it has led me to the most amazing people; it has opened my eyes to a brave and supportive community; and it has fundamentally changed how I answer the question: <em>what is a voice?</em> My voice is my stutter, and my stutter is my voice.</p>

<p><img align="right" width="40%" style="padding-left:10pt" src="/assets/images/nsa/vea.jpg" /></p>

<p>Around a year and half ago, I was on my computer doing homework when a thought popped into my head. <em>There must be a conference for people who stutter! There must be.</em> A few google searches later and I landed on the National Stuttering Association website (<a href="westutter.com">westutter.com</a>). The countdown for the next conference was only a few months away, so I knew it was too late to go. So I waited, then revisited the page this spring and registered for the 2022 NSA Conference in Newport Beach, California! Thanks to the generosity of my <a href="https://harveyscholars.mines.edu/vision/">scholarship donors</a>, I was able to get all of the conference expenses paid for!</p>

<p>The months leading up to the conference, I wasn’t nervous at all. I’m pretty comfortable with my stutter and I have worked hard to accept it into my life. That excitement continued as I boarded my Tuesday evening flight from Denver to Orange County. And then I landed, and a tickle of nervousness crept into my belly. And then I got to the hotel late on the eve of the first day of the conference and I heard a stutter that wasn’t my own! Someone in the lobby was talking to the hotel concierge and stuttering! The nerves set in even deeper.</p>

<p><img align="left" width="40%" style="padding-right:10pt" src="/assets/images/nsa/nametag.jpg" /></p>

<p>The next morning I meandered to the lobby as the check-in time of 12pm neared. I knew absolutely <strong>zero</strong> people. To be honest, I was terrified. I waited in line to register, hearing stutters echo around me and I felt like running away and hiding. I managed to have a few conversations, but I was still feeling awful. I escaped the crowded lobby and headed back to my room, an instinct that fellow introverts can surely relate to. On my way to my room, a man was seated on a bench in the hallway. He was a bit older, but his name badge was very long and colorful, indicating a long tenure with the NSA. We made eye contact and I slowed down. He got out of his chair and asked me my name and whether I was a Person Who Stutters (PWS). I responded yes. I think he could see my nervousness, so he said, “Go out there and be in as many conversations as you can, meet as many people as you can”. In that moment, that advice seemed impossible. I wanted to do quite the opposite. But, his voice had a ring of truth, so I held onto his advice as I thanked him and returned to my room. I called my mom and my boyfriend to ground myself before taking a deep breath and going back down to the lobby for the first event: a first-timers workshop. Within the course of an hour, my entire perspective changed. I was no longer in the “real-world”. I was with my people. I was with other stutters who understood not only what it feels like to have a stutter, but what it feels like to be alone. <em>I surely wasn’t alone anymore.</em></p>

<p><img align="right" width="40%" style="padding-left:10pt" src="/assets/images/nsa/beach.png" /></p>

<p>The next few days proved to be life-changing in all the ways I had predicted and all of the ways I hadn’t. I met stutters younger than me. Stutters my age. Stutters older than me. Stutters from all over the country and world. Stutters with small s-stutters. Stutters with l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-long s-s-s-s-s-stutters. Stutters who are overt (they stutter in front of anyone and everyone). Stutters who are covert (they sometimes hide their stutter using tricks like changing words. I found out that I am a pretty covert stutterer). I also met many supporters of stutters, including but not limited to: fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, spouses, speech language pathologists, and friends. I went to many workshops, including one on stuttering acceptance, a covert open-mic (which I was able to speak at and tell my story), and a “Passing Twice” workshop. This was a workshop for people who stutter and are in the LGBTQ+ community. In the workshop I heard the most amazing stories from people who have risen up to accept themselves in their stutter and sexuality/gender identity. After the workshop, they offered a sign-up link for anyone who wanted to continue the conversation at a dinner the following evening. At this point in the conference, I was leaning heavily on the advice of the man in the hallway, so I said <em>why not!</em> and I signed up.</p>

<p><img align="left" width="40%" style="padding-right:10pt" src="/assets/images/nsa/group.png" /></p>

<p>When I showed up in the lobby to walk to dinner with the others who had signed-up, I had no clue that many of them would become dear friends of mine. Over the course of the next few days I came to know and respect a group of amazing human beings, all with an inspiring story (or two). We talked and talked and talked and talked, and stuttered and stuttered and stuttered and it felt <em>SO GOOD</em>. We were all truly in heaven, and consistently reminding each other that the NSA conference was something really special. Many long-time NSA Conference attendees told me over and over again that the conference was an inflection point for them, especially when I introduced myself as a first-timer. I heard excitement in their voice as they realized I was experiencing the conference for the very first time, possibly as they reminisced memories of their first conference, years or decades before.</p>

<p>I stuttered more in the span of 4 days than I have in last 4 months, and it felt amazing. Being there among fellow stutterers truly changed how I view stuttering. For much of my life, I viewed my stutter as a burden to those around me– something to hide and mask. But, hearing so many beautiful stutters taught me the power of patience and graciousness in a world that expects us to speak too quickly. The conversations I had were deep, engaging, and heartfelt. The stutters were open and free to dance in their repetitions and blocks (a block is when a stutter is silent, making it seem like the stutterer has paused).</p>

<p><img align="right" width="30%" style="padding-left:10pt" src="/assets/images/nsa/dance.png" /></p>

<p>At the final Saturday night banquet, by happenstance, I sat next to the man that I met in the hallway on the very first day. I told him that his advice was brilliant, and that my conference had been particularly magical because of it. The rest of the night, my new friends and I danced and celebrated together, holding each moment close to our hearts as we prepared to depart back to the “real-world”. I intend on attending many more NSA conferences over the coming years, but I this one will remain close to my heart as it was my first conference. My first time meeting that many stutterers. My first time learning true patience. My first time understanding the support provided by the NSA. And my first time <em>truly</em> letting my stutter fly :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="praxis" /><category term="stuttering" /><category term="conference" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My stutter is a gift.

My voice is my stutter, and my stutter is my voice.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="/misc/2022/05/30/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2022-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/misc/2022/05/30/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="/misc/2022/05/30/welcome-to-jekyll.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
