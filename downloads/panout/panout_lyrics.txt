Do you remember all the times
when we just looked each other in the eyes
Do you remember all the days
when our love put us in a craze

Pan out on your life
Pan out on my life
You'll see quite the view
of a boy in love with you

Do you remember all the nights
that I held you close and tight
Do you remember all the tears
that you wiped clear

Pan out on your life
Pan out on my life
You'll see quite the view
of a boy in love with you

Who am I? Who are you?
Who I am, Who you are
Who are we? Who we are
x2

Pan out on your life
Pan out on my life
You'll see quite the view
of a boy in love with you

in love with you...
in love with you...
in love with you...
...
