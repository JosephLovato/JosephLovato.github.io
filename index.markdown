Hello there! I am an energetic computer scientist, creative problem solver, and powerful communicator who is passionate about a growth mindset, pedagogy, technical dexterity, and collaboration in a time when intelligent systems and modern algorithms are changing the way people interact with computers and each other.

In complement to my journey as a computer scientist, I am also a writer, philosopher, musician, and filmmaker.

## How to navigate this site

Aristotle, the esteemed Greek Philosopher, believed that there exists three basic activities for the human mind: theoria, poiesis, and praxis. In honor of Aristotle's wise teachings and historic legacy, I have structured my website by these three activities:

[Theoria](theoria.html): Activities for the sake of learning and truth seeking. My theoria will consist of journalism, book reviews, tech articles, and the like.

[Poiesis](poiesis.html): Activities for the sake of production. My poiesis will consist of projects in all disciplines (software, art, video, etc.)

[Praxis](praxis.html): Activities for the sake of action. My praxis will consist of blog posts documenting my experiences (travel, conferences, food, etc.)
