<img style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;" src="assets/images/profile.png" width=200px title="shout out to my friend Malaya for taking this amazing candid shot with a film camera!">

Hello there! I am an energetic computer scientist, creative problem solver, and thoughtful communicator with a passion for teaching, learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration in a time when intelligent systems and complex algorithms are changing the way people interact with computers, each other, and the world.
In complement to my journey as a computer scientist, I am also a writer, philosopher, musician, filmmaker, gym-goer, and traveler.

## How to navigate this site

Aristotle, the esteemed Greek Philosopher, believed that there exists three basic activities for the human mind: theoria, poiesis, and praxis. In honor of Aristotle's wise teachings and historic legacy, I have structured my website by these three activities:

üìñ [Theoria](theoria.html): Activities for the sake of learning and truth seeking. My theoria consists of journalism, book reviews, tech articles, and the like.

üíª [Poiesis](poiesis.html): Activities for the sake of production. My poiesis consists of projects in all disciplines (software, art, video, etc.)

üõ´ [Praxis](praxis.html): Activities for the sake of action. My praxis consists of blog posts documenting my experiences (travel, conferences, food, etc.)
